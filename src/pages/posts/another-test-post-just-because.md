description: Just testing another post because I didn't touch this project over the weekend

So I am writing another test post today because I didn't touch this project over the weekend and I wanted to make sure it is still working somewhat properly. Last week I couldn't get the image to load and I still can't so I don't know if the images are like not importing properly or yeah not really sure what is going wrong. Especially because it works fine in the local test server.

- 2 pounds panko bread crumbs
- 45 grams of sugar
- 3 mini muffin trays 10 by 20

1. First take the breadcrumbs and soak them in water over night
2. next pour 44 grams of sugar in a pot and put on the stove on high for 3 hours
